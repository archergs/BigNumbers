# BigNumbers
BigNumbers (better name coming soon!) is a C++ library that enables the storage of really really big numbers. I'm sure something like this already exists, I haven't checked, as this is mostly just a learning tool for myself. Feel free to contribute or help where you can, who knows maybe there is an actual use for this thing!
